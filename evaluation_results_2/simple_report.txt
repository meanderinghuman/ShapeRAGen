SIMPLE EVALUATION REPORT
========================

OVERALL RESULTS
--------------
Total tests conducted: 200
Overall success rate: 95.5%

BEST PERFORMING CONDITION
------------------------
review_only with 100.0% success rate

RAG EFFECTIVENESS
----------------
Success rate WITH RAG: 92.0%
Success rate WITHOUT RAG: 99.0%
Improvement: -7.0 percentage points

This means RAG increases success by -7.0%!

EXECUTION TIME
-------------
Average time WITH RAG: 63.0 seconds
Average time WITHOUT RAG: 38.7 seconds
Difference: 24.4 seconds (62.9% increase)

ITERATIONS TO SUCCESS
-------------------
Average iterations overall: 1.4
Average iterations WITH RAG: 1.5
Average iterations WITHOUT RAG: 1.2
Difference: 0.2 iterations

SHAPE ANALYSIS
-------------
Hardest shape to generate: pyramid
Easiest shape to generate: box

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
-----------------------
Is the RAG improvement statistically significant?
NO (p-value: nan)

Effect size (Cohen's d): -0.34 (medium)
This is a measure of how meaningful the difference is in practical terms.

CONCLUSION
----------
RAG does not appear to improve code generation success in this test.
